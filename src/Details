1) On start should appear window with command line
    commands:
        quit,
        help,
        open (file name),
        save (without params - same file name),
        add (vertex),
        remove (vertex),
        update (vertex),
        draw - draw graph
        show data (matrix of incidenses), or other

2) Intellisence

 - on tab or start printing it should show first 5 possible lines -> on next symbol filter -> key down & enter - choose this
 - in case of incorrect input - error

 first command
    quit, help, open (filename), new (filename)
    open -> filename not exist, other error during access the file
    new -> such file already exist
    new -> add, remove, update vertices & type of them
        -> type of matrix
    draw -> draw grapth
    print -> & type of data  - matrix, edjes, vert & incidences...
